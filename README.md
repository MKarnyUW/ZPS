# ZPS - Machine Learning of Interference Patterns
### What am I?
This repository acts as code storage for a joint student project, by students from University of Warsaw. We had the goal of looking into Machine learning, using light interference patterns as our case study, and getting the hang of cooperation via Git, results of which are present in this page. For details on the results and our journey through them, you can check out the report.pdf file in the main directory.

### What do you plan to do with the code?
This was a one-semester long project that has come to a close. All code is commented and should be run-able, however we have no plans to extend it at the present time.

### Can I use the code present in here?
Yes, you can go through the code and expand on it if you have such a need, we simply ask you to link to here within references, just as we did to our materials within the aforementioned report.
